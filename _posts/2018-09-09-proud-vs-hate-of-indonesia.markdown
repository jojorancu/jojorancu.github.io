Are you proud to be an Indonesian? Or, did you disappointed with  the people who hates their own nation while its growing better? Well, did you do something good for your own country?

![Proud Or Hate!](/images/proudvshate.png "Proud Or Hate")

Social media, internet and technologies are being used to help people for daily needs and keep connected while they are in range. Many people use it quite right, but still tons of them are using it for bad things. **Hate speech**, **provocation**, **racism**, **online bullying**, and **bad content** are across the interconnected computer networks or we call it *internet*. In Indonesia or maybe the other side of the world, people use technology with *Good* and *Bad* intention. Not to mention, you might found lots of *Bad* happened.

## Indonesia

A country, **Republic of Indonesia**, located in *South-East Asia*. World's largest island country, *13k++ islands*. *700++ languages, 300++ ethnic groups*. Currently have *34 province*, *735++ square miles*. *261 mil ++ population*, nearly 90% of them adhering to [*Islam*][islam-wiki].

Yes, such a big country and one of the potential great-future nation. Local people are nice and have a good manner to serve others due to their culture. But when [*western culture*][western-culture-wiki] comes in, they changed. Especially when it comes to tech, or internet and it is ***FREE***!. People are still not wise to choose whether its good to implement or not, more likely they don't know how to use it for their own good and not to do bad things with it. For example, they are really happy when there is internet for daily uses. Remembered at that time, it could be used for share what is our current feeling or information &mdash; called status and post it to the social media and other users could react to it.

In many ways, they found this really helpful and connecting people when they don't have time to meet at the real-world. But, bad things are happened sooner. While internet are being used for free, they start abuse it for their own intention, bad intention. Flaming and harassment to a person or group because they have different thoughts, as a minority, or might be personal problems. Until then hate speech &mdash; provocation posts are popular and because it is free there is no law for who starts it at that time.

## Social Media

Yes, a *feel-free to argue* platform. From Friendster to Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and many other public room including forum. That is all to express and share your thoughts, feels, ideas, and even your personal information. Some are used for good purposes. People felt the benefit from the social media that connected them and sharing information while they are in range, even with strangers. But as there is always balance in all things, this social-media thing would have its darkside too. Well, people start using it to provoke other users by sharing personal-problem thought. They harassing people too using this technology. They start flaming each other, and could ended up to real-world fighting problem if they really wanted to.

In Indonesia, social media are used to share people thoughts about something since it is a democracy country. By that mean, if you are being Indonesia Citizen you could express your thoughts and ideas to make things *better*. Well, even though some of them abuse this condition. The content, images, videos, writings, etc are intended to express their feels and the way they think of it. A good content would be used for learning, share news, and even unknown knowledge that could led you to be successful. Bad content would led you to things not right, like flaming comment, sexual harassment, online bullying, and maybe another content that could not mentioned here. Thank God, there is so much good content that shared open-widely to the community in Indonesia but could not be separated with bad comments to the content. Haters gonna be hate anyway.

## Proud, Do Something!

They, author of thought and idea in every type of content have their own haters. Nothing is perfect even humans or robots, Perfection is only for God. But still, people would mock you if they found it. **Starts** from they comment on your posts and write something bad, **to** where author's private life are being controlled by the people.

> "Your content is sucks, you don't belong here, change your nationality, Indonesia do not need people like you" said Bad Person.
> 
> "You broke up with XXX?? And now date with YYY?!? LOL, you better date with XXX or ZZZ, they still better than YYY." said Another Bad Person.

Yes, this is happened more than you can count. Sadly, it happens in Indonesia where the Ancient Culture is to serve people better and with manner. This is not Indonesia, all of the bad person mentioned. And many other example that could not be shared due to their violent words. Why you don't create your own content if you felt or seen theirs are not that good? Why you wanted to try to expel them to leave the country like you have the authority? Why you are being *love matchmaker* suddenly for them? LOL, things getting not right, it is their life dude. Live your own, ***YOLO***!

Instead of criticize with bad intention to the author, why you didn't do something about it? Create better content, and prove your content are better. You would hate the content, but don't the author unless they are share bad contents. It is their thoughts, not yours. People are have their right to express opinion. Your job is to choose wisely the words for comment and which content should you follow or watch. You could do something better by proving your content are better. Make them impressed with your works/content so they could admit they were wrong.

You couldn't insists people who is to love. It is a personal problem, and it should be private &mdash; bond by lover's relationship not by *bad fans* command. When they broke up, once again, it is their problem. Maybe something aren't going well through the years. Maybe they have different purpose that could led them into chaos in the future. Maybe something else that cause them to admit the relationship could not go any longer and they decide to broke up. Until, they found someone else could fit in every side bad or good things in their life and then decide to date her/him. Well, did you have your own date? Are you still single? You should mind your own business, not to intervene someone's life. Find your own soulmate, and you would understand love &mdash; commitment to stay with your *once in a life* choice.

## Indonesia in World's Glasses

This is funny. People from all over the world glad to come to Indonesia. They are very pleased to see how the locals manner, the food, and of course Bali. Many of them thought Bali is not in Indonesia. For all of you who don't know, [Bali][bali-wiki] &mdash; *Island of Gods*, is one of the island that has beautiful panoramic and culture located in Indonesia territory. Even domestics are very excited with the vacation on the island.

Jakarta, well-known big city and also the capital city of Indonesia. With it's famous *catastrophic traffic* where heavy traffic and horns are placed into the road concurrently. They, as foreigners know this very well and felt annoyed with it, especially westerns.

There are lot of them (foreigners) travels to different location in Indonesia. For example there are lot of tourist from all over the world come to Indonesia for hiking, diving, or even do something they just can find and experienced it in Indonesia. Yes, Indonesia is rich of it's natural beauty. Even maybe foreigners have lot of times and experienced to many places in Indonesia more than local people.

People from all over the world are appreciate what happened Indonesia lately. Oh yes! The **Asian Games 2018**! The opening ceremony is so fantastic with recorded extreme action starring ***President of Indonesian Republic***, *Joko 'Jokowi' Widodo*, the jumping with his motorcycle to avoid the traffic jam in the capital city of Indonesia, Jakarta. The clip is about he tried to attend the opening ceremony from National Palace with his motorcycle **in time**! And.. yes he did it! He is on time and make it to the stage using the same motorcycle. Throttle towards to basement and park the motorcycle. Took lift to the president bench and BOOM! Everybody applaud and cheers for his entrance. You might felt the same thing too when you watch the clip, but the feelings for every people who attends and watch it live at the stadium are more fantastic. There is still, Indonesian people, don't like with the action and blame them because of that and this and blablabla while world so shock and appreciate with the opening ceremony and the President entrance because it was great and well-done.

When the games start and Indonesia failed in some of the sports, haters coming through to the front-seat to blame the athlete because losing the medal instead support them to be better next time. Don't know why the people are so hateful like that. They say something that not necessary and worst, bad words.

> "Shame! President use stuntman to do the jumping action with the motorcycle." said Ungrateful Person
> 
> "Stupid! Weak! Don't be an athlete if you could not get the medal" said Stupid Person

What the f*ck? That might be your first reaction. And yes, this is really happened. And it is said by the local people, same nation, same country, same blood and maybe same religion too. Why you think that President don't use stuntman to do something dangerous? It would be stupid if there is no stuntman for the action. And it is normal! Would normal people do the same action without stuntman? And the pathetic moment is when they yell at the stuntman is not from Indonesia. What the hell is that matter?? Did you want to use everything from Indonesia? Then, now you should not using computers or maybe smartphone to comment or criticize or even call or chats. Don't use internet because it is not from Indonesia. Don't drink or eat every food and beverages that is not local brands. Don't sleep at soft-bed that you have now, it is not made in Indonesia!

Shame on those people! Another one, why shouldn't you try to get the medal yourself? Prove it and make Indonesia proud of you! You did nothing and even you might be watch without your own effort/resources/money and still criticize people without reflect and see what did you do for your own nation, your own country, Indonesia.

## Conclusion

The thing is, when people are being free as freedom they could do anything they want as that not break the rules. But manner and ethics could not be bound with the freedom. It is chosen wisely by the people whether they want to be a bad person or a good one, at this matter is a technology usage. Social media being a place to express people opinion with every its form across nation and widely to the other side of the world. You could do something and make a better one than the other OR you want to be one of them who criticize so badly and do nothing. While there is still *stupid as f\*ck* people around the world especially in Indonesia, you always have an option to be better than them. **Don't hate Indonesia, be proud of it** with every single reps try-to-be-success from its people, sports, tradition, musical, brands, business, or even other achievements. Hate the people who don't appreciate and DO NOTHING about it. Because they don't deserve the success, not even to be part of Indonesia.
