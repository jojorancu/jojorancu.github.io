What if I told you be an *anti-mainstream* person / group aren't that bad? What if that being different than other people would gain you profit? In fact, there is almost all successful people takes lonely road.

# Habit by Rules

Sometimes people like to follow the rules or some sort of instructions, not to mention there are lot of people break rules and do their own way for their own reason. For example people in Indonesia mostly drivers are breaking traffic rules, they think it's normal, including me, and this is the fact! Like when you are in hurry of something or when you are in a panic situation like **dying of defecation**, this *rules* doesn't seems like important to you. This is a bad habit anyway, don't try this wherever you are kids!

Those bad habit or any other kind of it would lying on the system and sooner or later be like a normal habit which is its bad. Thats what happened to Indonesia's traffic system when people found that this habit are so helpful and could make profit from it. Even government took intervention for it &mdash; they caught people who are breaking the rules by doing raid check on **blind-spot** road so there will be people unconsciously being caught. You might felt it too, when you feels safe but after took several miles and turn right, turn left then *you might not see that coming*, bunch of cops are ahead and you don't have enough space and time to turn around - yet it is against the rules to drive on opposite direction.

I mean you could do something good as a habit even if you are breaking set of instructions or rules, and gain profit too. For example you might want to *collect* some sort of things like **money**, **stamps**, or any **antiques**. Normally, people would spent or save their money for something they plan or wanted to like buying foods, needs, and other entertain things. But you always have the option to collect the money to be your **money's collection** with hope that after 5 or more than 10 years that money you collected be a great history that would let you sell that with amazing prices more than its value.

# Reverse Time

In my current company that I work with, **Kawan Lama**, we (with my colleagues) have normal habit. It's about the lunch time. Everybody as an employee offered free lunch every single day. We have systems that show every date's menu and record which day (weekly) every single employee order the lunch menu on that day. So when you ordered, you have to attend and tap your ID card right before you got your food and also drinks on the pantry locket. When you did not order the lunch on that day, you have to wait like 15 minutes before the lunch time over OR you could simply go out and find yourself some food, there are lot of foods around the office.

After lunch time we always took down stairs, go out from the office when we still have time and go to nearest **Indomaret** to bought some foods, or something we need to `survive` until office hour is done. Because we are not allowed to get out from the office other than lunch time or it is already time to go home. This is our habit, or we could say this is the most people's habit who work in here. It's the only thing you could do to hang out with friends while you took long walk (let's say doing some sports) and thats legal (LOL). For us who have the habit flows in our blood, it is a must to go to the Indomaret. It is just like instruction or a routine for everyday we did after lunch.

Things getting crowdy, when you are trying to queue at the pantry and found that queue are long as hell. Most of us and many of the employee felt this queue grow bigger and longer every month. We determine and calculate that might be 1.5 times longer than usual queue right every 3 months. More people means more crowd to join the `Kawan Lama Lunch - Indomaret` habit. Queues at Indomaret after lunch are growth than we expect. Usually, we took around 2-3 minutes to queue but now we have to wait 5-10 minutes to get our orders served. We are given up and try something new, we call it **`REVERSE`** yes it is obvious because we are doing something first while others doing that lastly.

The idea of **`REVERSE`** is while people are queuing and not giving up with it (the normal habit), we took the chance of turning moment of the habit to `Indomaret - Kawan Lama Lunch`. At first we don't expect much, because we just don't want to queuing that long time at the pantry. After time to time, we have seen and felt that there is so much things are happened efficiently. When you arrive at Indomaret with this habit, you would be surprised that no one in there (except foreigners, not Kawan Lama employee) and the queues are too short anyway, it just took 1-2 minutes for you to be served. Done with Indomaret and street snacks, we are going to the pantry and surprised too that the queues are getting fewer like cutted off more than half of it.

# Compare with Benchmarks

While we do the **`REVERSE`** thing, we calculate and do benchmark with normal habit and the result are pretty impressive.

**Energy**: when you are queuing that long on the pantry, you would feel your energy are drained because you stand still and took 1 or 2 more steps and stop again and so on until you reach that *brightest pantry* you fit in. Nothing makes you interests and you keep doing this until you exhausted and re-think of it that all this time you wasting your resources. When you did **`REVERSE`** you took down stairs and go out of the office first, walk to Indomaret and bought something that you might needed or even bought street snacks around the office. Then while you walk back to the office, your stomach starts complaining and you feels hungry, thats good because it would allow you eat more than usual and thats not boring.

**Time**: taking too long queues on the pantry or even on the Indomaret are wasting your time. We found and calculate that `Kawan Lama Lunch - Indomaret` (normal habit) took **55 minutes** for the average time, and `Indomaret - Kawan Lama Lunch` (**`REVERSE`** habit) took **40 minutes** for the average time. From that data we could simply tell our **`REVERSE`** habit are more efficient by Time aspect. You could save 15 minutes everyday &mdash; that might be useful for you. For me 15 minutes are important even **a second of my life** is gold. I could use the time for learning what I wanted to like new Tech, Tools, or even read more books that could gain me more insight and gets me inspired.

We know this benchmark and data wont promise us this `kind of method` to keep getting profit. It would compromised by others that seen us doing something *fishy* anyway. So while we can, we took this **`REVERSE`** habit more often even we don't care about the pantry queues if it's long or short. We just take this *path of life* and trust that every time we did this, we gain more profit from **Energy** and **Time** aspects.

# Conclusion

In order to be successful of something, you have to do something different. Leader might teach, learn, and/or even command the team for some sort of reason or purpose. Everyone in that team could be a leader if and only if that member of the team think *differently* and *brilliantly* and doing something more like took more responsibility and ownership of the team while others thought something are *obviously* and doing nothing but just instructions. Successful person some time would took a lonely road to get their success moment, but there are quite people took their teams and build businesses or create their own company to move forth. There is so much options are available that you might took to being a successful person in some cases. For this `Kawan Lama Lunch` and `Indomaret` cases, we would took **`REVERSE`** solution for awhile now.
