Passionately curious about technology and extreme sports. Learn things more faster and deeper with dumbest ways. I love to solving problems and enjoying writing codes especially when it comes complex and trivial.

Writing this blog to improve my writing skills while explain about shared contents and of course to develop technical skills and using various tools.

A Software Engineer, currently working with [Kawan Lama Group](https://www.kawanlama.com/) as full stack software engineer.

## Journey
In 2008, I started my first career as game fraud analyst at formerly called MGI. After passionately arrest people, I decided to move forward being a junior system administrator that help the server runs the business. Like other game server, ours are dead eventually. Early 2010 I joined with other private games server (Ragnarok, SEAL, etc) to contribute for their development servers. While contributing, I have side job as a graphic designer, video editor with or without effects, and remixing audio. Learn how to code and why code from this line, and thought that I really love to code. Thankfully, I had a chance to go to [UNPAR](http://unpar.ac.id/). I did study more on code, logic, even networks and servers as well. As a 3rd-year student in 2015, I joined with faculty program that hiring administrator for their labs. I learned a lot like there is no other place that could give this kind of experience. Setting networks, build servers, develop apps, interact with many lecturers and other bureaucracy, and contribute with campus program and events. Graduate as a bachelor, and start to working full-time as a software engineer.
